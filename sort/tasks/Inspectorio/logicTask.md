You have 2 ropes and lighter. Each rope is burned down in exactly 1 hours, however the speed is not linear and changing over time, so that it's possible that half of rope burned down in 5 minues while another half will be burning down for remaining 55 minutes.

Your task is to count 45 minutes somehow. :)
